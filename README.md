# servlet-jsp-login-and-register-page
 
## Introduction 

This project is my Funix 3 assignment using jsp and servlet to make a login and register page

## version
-	Java 12
-	Spring Tool Suite 4 (Version: 4.3.2.RELEASE) 
-	Maven (version 3.6.1)
-	Tomcat (version 9.0.22) but not included in this assignment. As a result please download yourself 
-	Bootstrap (version 4.3.1)
- Other components are used according to “pom.xml” in each project

## Project Detail:

. If first time access and no user is registered . A warning will be issued to ask for registering a user.
-	After that register user and validate as usal 
-	All users information will be written as “users.txt” on the server (where I place the file maynot be optimal)
-	Although bootstrap is used on every page, I knew that my design skill is lacking. In fact , I hate design (except software design). As a result, I can’t think of anything so just using like that to prove I know bootstrap 
-	The project follows the MVC architecture 
-	Other JSP file in “parts” folder is to be included inside other JSP file 
-	JSTL is used inside every View JSP
-	The project is coded so that only after successfully login user can acess other page 
-	A repreasentative of session is coded . However compare to a session in Spring projects this type of “session” is awfully lacking

## Possible Issue
-	Minimal testing and only follow Funix requirement. And not yet trying to break the system by myself so there maybe bug outside of Funix Requirement

## Known Issue
-	Bad front-end design: I hate graphic design so please
